# Stable-Galaxy
This project contains two Python scripts, galaxytop.py and galaxyangled.py, that generate 3D animations of a rotating spiral galaxy using Matplotlib. Each script simulates a galaxy with spiral arms and a central bulge, rendered with a color gradient and star glow effect, and saves the output as an MP4 video.
